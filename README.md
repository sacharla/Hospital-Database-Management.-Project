# Hospital-Database-Management.-Project

• Created a database using Microsoft SQL server database thatstores complete details of patients, nurses, supervisors, doctors,
insurance plans and doctor backup. Also, Visual Studio Code to build a MongoDB Playground for the same project.
• For this project the aim was to create a complex architecture where the Hospital Administrator will have access to the
patient’s database to pull the historical records of the patient’s diagnosis with the hospital and the historical reports of
the hospital workers designated to treat the particular set of patients.
